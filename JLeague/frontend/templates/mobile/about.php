			<p>
			The Southwest Illinois Baseball League was formed in 2005 with the the purpose of giving children in 
			the surrounding communities of Southwestern Illinois the opportunity to play the game of baseball at 
			a highly competitive and enjoyable level!   In 2005, the league was formed with only one (1) division 
			with approximately 10 teams.  We have continually seen growth each year where in 2013, we reached our 
			highest participation rate of 167 teams across 20 divisions in 10 different counties (Greene, Calhoun, 
			Jersey, Montgomery, Madision, Bond, Clinton, St. Clair, Monroe and Washington counties).
			</p>
			<p>
			Teams should plan to typically play 16-20 games per season.  The season runs between April through the 
			first week of July.  Teams also have an opportunity to participate in the year end playoffs scheduled 
			for early July.  We currently support age groups 7U-14U.  Each age group is separated into divisions
			based on skill.  The American division are typically Class "A" type teams.  The National division teams
			can be Class "AA" or higher teams.
