	<li><strong>Completion of the registration process does NOT guarantee a spot in the league. </strong> The league reserves the right to 
		accept/reject any teams registration.  We will do our best to properly place teams in the appropriate age group/division.  However,
		factors such as geographic location, travel distance for other teams and total teams within the age group/division, etc. will all 
		need to be considered when evaluating a teams registration request.
